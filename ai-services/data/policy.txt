Procurement Order Validation Policy

All product recommendations generated by the procurement agent must be evaluated to ensure they are cost-effective, contract-compliant, operationally appropriate, and explainable before being approved for purchase. The agent should prioritize products that are covered by existing contracts whenever such options are available. If an off-contract product is recommended while a contract-compliant alternative exists, the agent must explicitly flag the recommendation, present the compliant alternative, and clearly justify why the off-contract option is being proposed.

Orders must respect the remaining budget for the current procurement period. If a proposed order exceeds the available budget, the agent is required to challenge the recommendation by identifying lower-cost alternatives, suggesting reduced quantities, or deferring non-critical items. Any recommendation that exceeds budget thresholds must include a clear explanation of financial impact and rationale.

Product availability and delivery reliability must be considered for all recommendations. Products with low inventory levels, extended lead times, or elevated delivery risk should not be recommended for urgent or operationally critical needs unless no suitable alternatives exist. In such cases, the agent must surface the associated risks and propose more reliable substitutes where possible.

The agent must also assess cost reasonableness by comparing proposed pricing against historical purchasing data and comparable alternatives. Products priced significantly above historical averages or similar options should be challenged, with the agent identifying potential savings opportunities and justifying any premium pricing when maintained.

Recommended order quantities must align with projected usage and current inventory levels. Orders that materially exceed forecasted demand or existing inventory needs should be challenged, with adjusted quantities proposed unless overstocking is explicitly justified by seasonal demand, supply risk, or other operational factors.

Finally, all procurement recommendations must be fully explainable and auditable. The agent must be able to clearly articulate why a specific product, supplier, quantity, and timing were selected, including considerations of cost, compliance, availability, inventory, and budget. Recommendations that cannot be clearly explained must be regenerated before approval.
